## About this repo
The primary git repository for this site is on Pantheon.  [Pantheon has thorough documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/collaborative-development/#add-the-pantheon-site-as-a-git-remote) for how to sync between that repo and this one.  It is easiest to maintain a separate repository on your local machine with a .gitignore file that whitelists only what we want to commit to GitHub, as outlined [by Sal Ferrarello](https://salferrarello.com/wordpress-gitignore/).
