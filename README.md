# CoA WordPress Theme

## How did we make this theme?
This repository represents a fraction of the work we have put in to create a new website.  The other steps have included:
1. Looking at websites for cities all over the world and deciding that we don't want to make people learn about the entire structure of government just to pay their water bill
1. Poring through the analytics for our old website and using them to make a list of essential services the city provides
1. Conducting card sorting with the community to help us determine how to group these services into categories
1. Interviewing customer service representatives for the city to try to understand what kind of questions people ask them
1. Conducting internal usability testing with city employees to vet our content for accuracy and usability
1. Conducting external usability testing to vet our structure for usability

## About this repo
The primary git repository for this site is on Pantheon.  [Pantheon has thorough documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/collaborative-development/#add-the-pantheon-site-as-a-git-remote) for how to sync between that repo and this one.  It is easiest to maintain a separate repository on your local machine with a .gitignore file that whitelists only what we want to commit to GitHub, as outlined [by Sal Ferrarello](https://salferrarello.com/wordpress-gitignore/).
